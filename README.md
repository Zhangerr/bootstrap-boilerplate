bootstrap-boilerplate
=====================

Just a skeleton project you can clone into any time to have a fully working project with bootstrap, LESS, font-awesome, and jquery, some of the most popular tools of the web.
uses latest versions of stable libs as of 5/12/13:
bootstrap 2.3.1
font-awesome 3.1.1
less 1.3.3

using LESS doesn't seem to work locally, unfortunately, because of the strict enforcement of AJAX to load LESS files to be http only.
